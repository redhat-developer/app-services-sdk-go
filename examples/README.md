# RHOAS GO SDK examples

## Prerequisites

1. Go to  <https://console.redhat.com/openshift/token> and press "Load token".
2. Copy token from clipboard to `rhoas_token` file
3. Set env variable containing token `OFFLINE_TOKEN=$(cat rhoas_token)`

## Running examples

To run examples execute `go run`

### For example

### For kafkamgmt

```shell
go run ./examples/kafkamgmt/kafka_mgmt.go
```

### For connectormgmt

```shell
go run ./examples/connectormgmt/connector_mgmt.go
```

### For srsmgmt

```shell
go run ./examples/srsmgmt/srs_mgmt.go
```

## Setting up urls for instance SDK examples

Instance SDKS like registryinstance and kafkainstance requre extra `API_URL` environment variable that is used to point to the root of the API.

This can be found using the "describe" commands.

```shell
rhoas service-registry describe
```

or

```shell
rhoas kafka describe
```

and the intended URL can be found under: "registryURL"

### For example

### For registryinstance

```shell
API_URL="yourUrl" ACCESS_TOKEN=`rhoas authtoken` go run ./examples/registryinstance/registryinstance.go
```

### For kafkainstance

```shell
API_URL="yourUrl" ACCESS_TOKEN=`rhoas authtoken` go run ./examples/kafkainstance/kafka_instance.go
```

#### Troubleshooting

One of the common issues one can encounter during use is incomplete commands due to lack of resources (eg: Service Registry artifacts)

This can be resolved by following the steps mentioned in the following file which explains RHOAS "how-to's" as well as a good documentation for first-time users.
